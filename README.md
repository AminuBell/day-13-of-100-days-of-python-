# Day 13: Debugging Challenge

Welcome to Day 13 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge! Today's challenge involves debugging a set of code snippets. The goal is to identify and fix the errors in each snippet to ensure the code runs smoothly. Let's dive in!

## Challenge Tasks:

### 1. Describe Problem

In the `my_function` snippet, there's an issue with the loop condition. It runs from 1 to 19, but the print statement inside the loop will never be executed. Fix the loop condition to make it work as expected.

### 2. Reproduce the Bug

In the `dice_imgs` snippet, there's an issue with indexing the `dice_imgs` list using the randomly generated `dice_num`. The indices in Python start from 0, so adjust the index to avoid an IndexError.

### 3. Play Computer

The `year` input snippet has a logical error. It prints "You are a millennial" if the year is greater than 1980 and less than 1994. Adjust the condition to include the upper bound as well.

### 4. Fix the Errors

In the `age` snippet, there's a syntax error. The indentation of the `print` statement is incorrect. Fix the indentation to make the code block inside the `if` statement.

### 5. Print is Your Friend

The `word_per_page` snippet has a typo in the equality check. Replace `==` with `=` to correctly assign the value to `word_per_page`.

### 6. Use a Debugger

The `mutate` function has an indentation issue. The `b_list.append(new_item)` and `print(b_list)` should be inside the loop. Adjust the indentation to fix the problem.

## How to Run:

Run each snippet individually and observe the output. Make necessary corrections based on the instructions provided above.

Feel free to document the changes you make and any lessons learned during the debugging process. Happy debugging!
